# GETTING STARTED

Pipex reproduces the behaviour of the shell pipe | command in c it launches as
`.pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile` and behaves as this line does in the shell `<infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile`.

in this project you'll encounter alot of new concepts:


* ***processes and inter-communication between processes***


but we wond start whit that we'll just start with basic functions and systeme calls and the logic behind the project :
```
./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile

                                                      The main process

```

The point is we read from **infile**, execute cmd1 with **infile** as input, send the output as an input for cmd2, which will write to **outfile.**

```
every command needs an stdin and out

       as stdin for cmd1                                                               as stdout for cmd2
